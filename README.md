# Traveling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithms
The TSP involves finding the shortest possible route for a salesman to visit a given set of cities exactly once and return to the starting point. TSP has practical applications in fields such as logistics, planning, and manufacturing.  
## Gentic Algorithms
Genetic algorithms are problem-solving methods inspired by natural evolution. They work by creating a population of potential solutions and improving them through processes like crossover (combining parts of solutions) and mutation (randomly altering solutions). This helps find the best solution over time.
### Genetic Algorithm Components
- permutation encoding
- order crossover (OX)
- swap mutation
### Permutation Encoding
Each chromosome's length corresponds to the number of cities, with the sequence of genes indicating the order in which these cities should be visited.
